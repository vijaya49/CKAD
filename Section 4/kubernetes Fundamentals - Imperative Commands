    - NodePort
    - ClusterIP 
    - Loadbalancer
5. ReplicaSet
6. Deployment


POD: 
    - A POD is a single instanceof an Application
    - A POD is the smallest object, that you can create in kubernetes.

ReplicaSet:
    - A ReplicaSet will maintain a stable number of PODs running at any given time
    - In short, it is often used to guarantee the availablity of specified number of identical pods.

Deployment: 
    - A Deployment runs multiple replicas of your application 
    - And automatically replaces any instances that fail or become unresponsive
    - Rollout & Rollback changes to applications.
    - Deployments are well suited for stateless apllications

What is stateful and stateless applications?

Service:
    - A service is an abstraction for pods, proividing a stable, so called virtual IP address.
    - Im simple terms, service sits infront of a POD and acts as a Loadbalacer.
